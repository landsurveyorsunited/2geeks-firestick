 A fullscreen modal using Bootstrap. The modal features fixed header, content, and footer sections. The idea is to use this on small mobile devices to avoid competing with scrolling on the body.

Added webkit scrollbar styles to better indicate scrollable content on iOS devices. Note this seems to only work with iOS5 and lower; tested with Browserstack.
